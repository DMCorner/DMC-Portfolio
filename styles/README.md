# Portfolio Website
My portfolio website built with NextJS and TailwindCSS. 

# Lessons Learned
This was the first project where I really began to play around with CSS and I have to say that it is very enjoyable to see its capabilities however there is still plenty to learn.

NextJS I also feel is an improvement over ReactJS. The most notable improvement is the rendering time which, while not perfect, are an improvement over my previous ReactJS projects.

# Potential Improvements
1) The home page seems a little lacking. In future I would hope to add my previous working experience.

2) Google maps between 2 points. Currently google maps only shows the location of my hometown. It would be nice if an employer could plot the distance quickly between their place of work and my hometown to quickly gauge if its a viable distance.

3) The dark mode has a much more attractive colour palette. The more I look at light mode the more I feel it needs an adjustment. 

# Deployment
